🎮 Enhanced Game Generation Prompt (Typing Rhythm Game)

Create a browser-based rhythm typing game inspired by the viral “Say the Word on Beat” challenge, with a health system and scalable level design.

The game displays 8 square tiles arranged in a 4×2 grid. Each tile represents an item, but all tiles use placeholder frames (e.g., blank cards labeled “Slot 1–8”). The system must be designed so tile images and associated words/letters can be swapped in later on a per-level basis.

A steady rhythmic beat plays. On each beat, one tile highlights in sequence. While a tile is highlighted, the player must type the correct input (preferably the first letter of the tile’s associated word) within the beat window.

Core Mechanics

One tile highlights per beat.

The player types a key during the active beat window.

Input is evaluated for:

Correct key

Correct timing

Results per beat:

Perfect

Late/Early

Miss

Health System

The player starts each level with a fixed amount of health (HP) (e.g., 100).

Every incorrect input (wrong key, early, late, or no input) reduces health by a configurable amount (e.g., −10 HP).

Health is displayed clearly in the UI (bar or numeric).

When health reaches 0, the game ends immediately with a Game Over state.

Health loss values should be configurable per difficulty or level.

Level System (Scalable Design)

The game should support multiple levels, where each level defines:

Tile word/letter mappings

Placeholder image references (to be replaced later)

Beat tempo (BPM)

Health loss per mistake

Tile order behavior (fixed, looped, or shuffled)

Levels should be represented as data objects, not hardcoded logic.

Example structure (conceptual):

level = {
  bpm,
  tiles: [
    { id, placeholderImage, expectedKey },
    ...
  ],
  damagePerMiss
}

Visual Design

Tiles are square, evenly spaced, and minimal.

Placeholder frames clearly indicate future image slots.

Active tiles are highlighted with glow, outline, or scale.

UI

Health bar or HP counter

Beat feedback (“Perfect”, “Miss”, etc.)

Current level indicator

Game Over screen with restart option

Technical Constraints

Implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

No external assets required

No real images — only placeholders

Architecture should allow easy expansion to new levels and assets

The final result should feel fast, tense, and replayable, where mistakes are punished through health loss, encouraging rhythm accuracy while remaining extensible for future content.
